# Kidney-stones-classification

The project aims at predicting whether someone has kidney stones based on urine measurements. The dataset was downloaded from Kaggle.
In the repository, the Rmarkdown html document can be found, where all the analysis are presented. For reproducibility, the Rmarkdown file is also available to be run on Rstudio.

The main tools and concepts used in the project:
- Basic exploratory analysis
- Principal Component Analysis
- 2 samples testing via parametric and non parametric methods
- Logistic regression
- Random forests
- Evaluation of classification models

NOTE: If the Rmarkdown is to be reproduced, directory should be changed and the dataset downloaded from the Kaggle page.
